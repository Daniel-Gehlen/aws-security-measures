# IMPLEMENTATION REPORT OF SECURITY MEASURES
**Date:** March 10, 2024  
**Company:** Abstergo Industries  
**Responsible:** Daniel Gehlen  

## Introduction
This report presents the process of implementing tools at Abstergo Industries, carried out by Maria Silva. The project aimed to list 3 security measures in conjunction with AWS services, with the purpose of increasing security within the company.

## Project Description
The project of implementing tools was divided into 3 security measures. The following are the stages of implementation:

### Measure 1:
Utilization of [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) to manage access permissions to AWS resources. This includes creating granular access policies and assigning permissions only to users necessary for their roles.

### Measure 2:
Implementation of [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) to log all activities performed on the AWS account, enabling auditing of user actions, identification of potential threats, and investigation of security incidents.

### Measure 3:
Configuration of [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/) to centralize and automate continuous monitoring of AWS resource security. This includes assessing compliance with security best practices, identifying vulnerabilities, and generating real-time alerts about potential threats.

## Conclusion
The implementation of tools at Abstergo Industries is expected to strengthen IT infrastructure security, providing benefits such as stricter access control, expanded visibility into cloud activities, and early detection of threats. It is recommended to continue using the implemented tools and to seek new technologies that can further improve the company's processes.
